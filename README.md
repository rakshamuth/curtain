ASCII Art Screensaver for your terminal sessions.

Sideways inspiration from TermSaver (https://github.com/brunobraga/TermSaver).

=============================================

+Print predefined ASCII Art image onto terminal

|     https://github.com/pwaller/pyfiglet

|     Take into account columns and rows of terminal

|     What kind of color resolution can we get with a basic terminal?

|     Eventually expand into converting gifs

+Have image printed after inactivity

|     Use a daemon to detect STDIN (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-daemon/)
